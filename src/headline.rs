//! Org headline structure, as pure line logic.
//!
//! ## Why text and not the parse tree
//!
//! `apply-action` receives `option<borrow<tree-snapshot>>` — this plugin's own
//! org tree — so walking it for `(headline (stars))` was the obvious route. It
//! is the wrong one here, for two reasons that are both paramount-goal
//! arguments rather than convenience ones:
//!
//! * **The tree can be absent.** `none` when the parse is pending. A chord that
//!   silently no-ops right after a paste, and works a moment later, is the
//!   worst kind of bug to report. Line logic has no such state (goal #2).
//! * **A query on the keystroke path costs more than the answer.** Recognising
//!   a headline is `^\*+\s` on one line. Compiling and running a query to learn
//!   the same fact is strictly more work inside the grammar seam's budget
//!   (goal #1).
//!
//! And it is not an approximation: a line whose first non-`*` character is a
//! space, at column 0, **is** a headline in org — including inside
//! `#+BEGIN_SRC`, which is precisely why org makes you escape such lines as
//! `,*`. Matching on text matches org's own rule.
//!
//! The tree stays valuable for what it is actually better at — tables, links,
//! blocks — and later slices use it there.
//!
//! ## Why these take a line accessor and not a `&[String]`
//!
//! Reading a line crosses the WASM boundary (`document.line(n)`), so
//! materialising the buffer to find one headline costs one guest→host call per
//! line — 10,000 of them on a 10,000-line org file, on every press of a key
//! that ends up editing three of them. At the seam's own budget that is
//! milliseconds, which is a missed frame (paramount goal #1).
//!
//! So every function here takes `line: impl Fn(u32) -> Option<String>` and
//! reads only what it needs: upward until a headline appears, downward until
//! the subtree ends. A headline operation touches a handful of lines whatever
//! the file size; a subtree operation touches its subtree, which it must read
//! anyway in order to rewrite it.

/// The level of `line` if it is a headline, else `None`.
///
/// A headline is one or more `*` at column 0 followed by a space. The trailing

/// and neither is a lone `*` on its own line (org requires the space, and a
