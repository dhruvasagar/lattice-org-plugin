//! The reference org language plugin.
//!
//! Implements the `language-plugin` world: imports `register-language`,
//! exports `register-languages`. The grammar is compiled to wasm by this
//! crate's build.rs and baked in with `include_bytes!`; the queries ship as
//! source and are compiled host-side at registration, so a malformed one
//! fails at load naming the file.
//!
//! OM.2 adds the third seam: `modes`, declaring `org-mode` as the MAJOR for
//! the language registered above. Until majors crossed the seam a `.org` file
//! opened in `text-mode` however good the grammar was, because
//! `major_mode_id_for_lang` is a hand-written match over the `Lang` enum and
//! has no arm for a language the host has never heard of.
//!
//! OM.3 adds the fourth: `grammar`, contributing the promote/demote actions
//! and binding them in `org-mode`'s own keymap layer. This is where the plugin
//! starts EDITING — the actions read the buffer through the `borrow<document>`
//! handle `apply-action` receives and return `Effect::ApplyEdit`.

// A plugin that provides TWO seams needs a world that imports both, and a
// component implements exactly one world. Bundled plugins get theirs written
// into lattice's own `wit/` (`auto-pair-plugin` imports six interfaces) — but
// an EXTERNAL plugin cannot add a world to someone else's package.
//
// It does not need to. WIT `include` composes worlds, and `wit-bindgen`
// resolves an `inline` package against the interfaces found at `path`, so the
// plugin declares its own world locally and gets ONE `Guest` trait carrying
// both exports. Nothing in lattice changes to allow it.
//
// Three details, each of which is a build error if missed:
//   * `include` needs the VERSION (`@0.1.0`) — the resolver knows
//     `lattice:plugin-host@0.1.0`, not `lattice:plugin-host`.
//   * `generate_all` — without it wit-bindgen demands a `with` mapping for
//     every interface reached through the include.
//   * the inline package needs its own name, distinct from lattice's.
