//! OM.2 — opening a `.org` file activates `org-mode`, a major mode that ships
//! inside a plugin.
//!
//! This is the slice's headline claim and the one that failed before it. The
//! host resolves a document's major through
//! `lattice_syntax::major_mode_id_for_lang`, a hand-written `match` over the
//! `Lang` enum whose `Lang::Plugin(_)` arm returns `None` **by design** — the
//! host cannot have an arm for a language it has never heard of. So however
//! good the org plugin's grammar was, a `.org` buffer landed in `text-mode`.
//!
//! The route was already designated (that arm's comment says a plugin
//! language's major "is contributed through the `modes` seam by the plugin that
//! owns it"); OM.1 built the registry's language index and OM.2 opened the seam
//! to majors. This test walks the whole path with the REAL reference plugin:
//! discover → load → `language` + `modes` seams drain → open a file → the
//! editor's ordinary activation resolves org-mode.
//!
//! ## Mode-ownership acid test
//!
//! Nothing in `lattice-host` knows what org is. No `Editor::` method, no
//! `Action` variant, no `BufferKind`, no `Lang` arm. The plugin contributed a
//! language and the major that owns it, and the generic resolver did the rest.
//!
//! Skips when the component was not built — `cargo test` builds this crate
//! for the HOST, and the component loaded below is a separate
//! `--target wasm32-wasip2 --release` artefact. The `org_folds.rs` precedent.
